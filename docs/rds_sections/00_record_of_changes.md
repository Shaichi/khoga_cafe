| 2026-06-18 | M | Software Engineering Team | Simplified Section 1.2 Package Diagram to follow the core MVC 6-package structure (bean, view, controller, filter, dao, util). |
| 2026-06-18 | M | Software Engineering Team | Rebuilt Section 2 (Database Design) ERD to display full column definitions (PK, FK, types) inside each entity, matching Visual Paradigm format. Restored all 21 SRS entities with exact columns from SRS §3.1.6. |
| 2026-06-18 | M | Software Engineering Team | Split Section 2 Database Design ERD into 2 diagrams (Core Sales & POS, Operations/Staffing/Audit) to prevent cluttering and improve readability. |
| 2026-06-18 | M | Software Engineering Team | Translated Section 2.1 & 2.2 titles/descriptions to English and unified font formatting (monospace inline code blocks) for database tables, columns, PK, FK, enums, data types, and roles. |
| 2026-06-18 | M | Software Engineering Team | Standardized Section 1.2 Package Diagram to UML package diagram conventions (Visual Paradigm style), organizing 18 subsystems into structured tiers with explicit dependency stereotypes (use, import, access). |
| 2026-06-18 | M | Software Engineering Team | Standardized all 4 Statechart diagrams (USER, VOUCHER, SHIFT, ORDER lifecycles) to UML-compliant syntax matching Visual Paradigm layout (Trigger [Guard] / Action format). |
| 2026-06-18 | M | Software Engineering Team | Standardized all 32 Sequence diagrams to UML method signature conventions, converting free-text labels to formal API/event operation calls. |
